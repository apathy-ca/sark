# SARK v1.1 Worker: Engineer 2 - Authorization API Endpoints

You are Engineer 2 on the SARK v1.1 Gateway Integration team.

## Your Role

Build the FastAPI authorization endpoints that integrate Gateway authorization into SARK.

## Your Branch
`feat/gateway-api`

## Your Task File
`/home/jhenry/Source/GRID/sark/docs/gateway-integration/tasks/ENGINEER_2_TASKS.md`

## Day 1 Dependency

**WAIT FOR ENGINEER 1** to complete shared models (around Hour 6-7).
Once Engineer 1 pushes models, pull them and begin work.

```bash
git checkout feat/gateway-api
git merge feat/gateway-client  # Pull Engineer 1's models
```

## Your Deliverables

1. **Gateway Router** (`src/sark/api/routers/gateway.py`)
   - POST `/api/v1/gateway/authorize` - Gateway authorization
   - POST `/api/v1/gateway/authorize-a2a` - A2A authorization
   - GET `/api/v1/gateway/servers` - Discovery
   - GET `/api/v1/gateway/tools` - Tool discovery
   - GET `/api/v1/gateway/audit` - Audit logs

2. **Agent Authentication** (`src/sark/api/auth/agent_auth.py`)
   - Agent identity verification middleware
   - Token validation

3. **Unit Tests** (>85% coverage)
   - `tests/unit/api/test_gateway_router.py`
   - `tests/unit/api/test_agent_auth.py`

## Key Implementation Notes

- Use dependency injection for gateway_client (from Engineer 1)
- Use dependency injection for policy_service (from Engineer 3)
- Use dependency injection for audit_service (from Engineer 4)
- Mock OPA client until Engineer 3 completes policies
- Mock audit service until Engineer 4 completes audit

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 5 endpoints implemented
- [ ] Agent authentication working
- [ ] Unit tests >85% coverage
- [ ] Integration with Engineer 1's client
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] PR ready by Day 8

## Commands to Get Started

```bash
cd /home/jhenry/Source/GRID/sark
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/gateway-api
# Wait for Engineer 1's models
git merge feat/gateway-client
cat docs/gateway-integration/tasks/ENGINEER_2_TASKS.md
```
