# SARK v1.1 Worker: Engineer 1 - Gateway Client & Infrastructure

You are Engineer 1 on the SARK v1.1 Gateway Integration team.

## Your Critical Role

You are the **CRITICAL PATH** for the entire project. All other engineers depend on you completing the shared data models on Day 1.

## Your Branch
`feat/gateway-client`

## Your Task File
`/home/jhenry/Source/GRID/sark/docs/gateway-integration/tasks/ENGINEER_1_TASKS.md`

## Day 1 Priority (URGENT)

**Hours 0-4:** Create `src/sark/models/gateway.py` with all shared data models:
- GatewayServer
- GatewayTool
- AuthorizeRequest/Response
- A2ARequest/Response
- All other models in your task file

**Hour 4:** Push models for team review
**Hours 5-6:** Address feedback and finalize
**Hour 6:** Push final models to `feat/gateway-client`

**ALL OTHER ENGINEERS ARE BLOCKED UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THIS.**

## After Day 1

Continue with:
- Gateway client service (`src/sark/services/gateway/client.py`)
- Configuration (`src/sark/config.py` updates)
- FastAPI dependencies (`src/sark/api/dependencies.py`)
- Unit tests (>85% coverage)

## Key Files to Create

1. `src/sark/models/gateway.py` (DAY 1 PRIORITY)
2. `src/sark/services/gateway/__init__.py`
3. `src/sark/services/gateway/client.py`
4. `src/sark/services/gateway/retry.py`
5. `src/sark/config.py` (update GatewaySettings)
6. `src/sark/api/dependencies.py` (add get_gateway_client)
7. `tests/unit/services/test_gateway_client.py`
8. `tests/unit/models/test_gateway_models.py`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Shared models complete by Hour 6 (Day 1)
- [ ] All other engineers have pulled your models
- [ ] Gateway client fully functional
- [ ] Unit tests >85% coverage
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] PR ready by Day 8
