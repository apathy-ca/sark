# Architecture

> **Note**: This document will be populated once the design document is provided and implementation begins.

## Overview

TBD - Awaiting design document.

## System Components

TBD

## Data Flow

TBD

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose v2
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **Type Checking**: MyPy (strict mode)
- **Code Quality**: Black, Ruff, Bandit

### Development Tools

- **Version Control**: Git with Conventional Commits
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks
- **Dependency Management**: pip with requirements files

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Strict type checking with MyPy
2. **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting
3. **Testing**: High test coverage (>80%)
4. **Security**: Regular security scans with Bandit
5. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and code standards
6. **Scalability**: Docker-based deployment ready for scaling

## Future Considerations

- API design patterns
- Database architecture (if needed)
- Caching strategy (if needed)
- Message queue integration (if needed)
- Microservices architecture (if applicable)
